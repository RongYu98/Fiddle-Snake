      <!-- Python's history and interests -->
<br>Why is Python 3.0 interesting?
<br>
<p>
Python is a really simple user friendly language. The user doesn't have to concern himself with the smaller details. For example, he doesn’t have to worry about memory allocation like in C, which Python is made from.
Because of the large community willing to support Python, it likely will continue to be an important programming language.
Why was Python 2.0 abandoned for 3.0? 
They wanted to remove all duplicate structures and functions to align more with "There should be one- and preferably only one -obvious way to do it, meaning they wanted to streamline the usage so that everyone would do things in the same way."

<br>What are some hindrances caused by Python 3.0?
<p>
According to David A.Wheeler Phd in Information Technologies, Python 3.0 is an improvement, however developers made a large mistake not making 2.0 and 3.0 into a single executable
This was a mistake because not all python 2.0 libraries are supported in python 3.0, and many pieces of software use libraries that use libraries that use ..... (etc) to function.
This in turn causes people with large python 2.0 projects to have broken code in the python 2.0 to 3.0 conversion.

	8-bit strings and Unicode, 'hi' and u'hi', have been replaced with text and binary, 'hi' and b'hi'.
	<br>

	They look similar, but unlike strings and unicode, text and binary CANNOT be combined. Any attempts to do so will meet an error.
	The reason this change was made lies in the problem with combining strings and unicode. Generally, unicode comes from an outside source, like a website.
	Because they come from outside, they may contain non-ASCII characters. On the other hand, strings are called 8-bit strings because they're 8 bits, they cannot handle anything more.
	In most cases the, unicode and strings could be combined freely because they only had ASCII characters. However, once the unicode had other things, an error would be thrown. 
	These errors would be really annoying to debug, because they're only raised in some cases while not in others.
	By seperating them, it is much easier to debug.
	<br> They can be converted to the other with bytes(s, encoding=...) or str(b, encoding=...).

  Fortunately, there exists such a function called 2to3. It will convert your Python 2.0 code to Python 3.0 code for you. However, nothing is perfect, it will only fix the majority of it. There will probably be some parts that you will still need to manually fix. On the brightside, you can customize it to fit you program.
